# Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing

## Course Completed at University of Denver Ritchie School of Computer Science and Engineering, Spring 2019

## Course Description

This course will covered widely used parallel and distributed computing methods, focusing on datacenter-scale distributed software and methods such as MapReduce, Spark, and distributed graph algorithms. We'll study the types of algorithms which work well with these techniques, and have the opportunity to implement some of these algorithms. We'll also look at the types of hardware architectures which have been developed along with these computing methods.
